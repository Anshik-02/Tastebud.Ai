Buttermilk Pie,,PT20M,PT1H20M,"This recipe was origilly noted by my wife on a cooking show on TV.  It was touted as an Amish recipe.  All we had for a long time was the list of ingredients on the back of an old envelope.  We lost it for a good while and after I found it, I origilly posted it so I would never lose it again.   Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the &quot;lost&quot; phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost.

Chicha Perua,,PT2H45M,PT4H35M,"Chicha (corn beer). Chicha is made in South and, to a lesser extent, Central America. Unlike African opaque beer, it is not brewed commercially, but instead is made and served in what sound to me like wee tiny brewpubs. An abbreviated version is also made in people's kitchens. Chicha is consumed whilst still fermenting and so is low in alcohol. It is often spiced and may also be served with fruit.  With Bill's help and a little patience, a friend and I recently completed a batch. This was a very interesting and satisfying endeavour which included growing and malting the corn used.

Be warned that chicha is at its peak 2 to 4 days after pitching while it still retains some sweetness and body."", 
""Once the chicha ferments out, you are left with a fairly bland beverage that reminds me of iced tea more than anything else. If I'd been thinking (chicha lends itself to gulping), I would have kegged the stuff on the third day after pitching and stuck it in the fridge. While we took the trouble to grow our own (blue) corn, I see no reason why one could not start with good ol' yellow corn from the grocery store (domestic 20-row?) In fact, I plan on doing this if only to see what kind of chicha it makes."", 
""Specifics:  OG: 1.055  FG: 1.012 Types of Chicha So far, there appear to me to be several main ways in which chicha de jora is made. These range in difficulty from trivial to a process almost indentical to what barley-beer homebrewers are familiar with."", ""Facil (easy) - Corn is mixed with water and sugar and allowed to sit for several days until the corn begins to germite. The sugar ferments and the corn, lending nothing fermentable, adds flavor."", ""Abbreviated - The jora is mashed but the mash is ultimately brought to a boil, allowed to settle, and the clear liquid, or upi, now finished chicha, is drawn off."", 
""Traditiol - Similiar to the Abbreviated method, but the jora is mashed and the mash is allowed to settle. The upi is drawn off the mash into a separate vessel for boiling."", ""Modern - The ground jora is mashed and lautered through some sort of filtering device such as a manifold or false bottom."", ""This process is helped by the inclusion of some crushed malted barley (Barley Assisted). The first is apparently how much chicha is made in people's kitchens."", ""Bill Ridgely describes most of the others in his articles."", 
""Also note that the methods that include mashing use a batch sparge. That is, the sweet liquor (upi) is merely drained from the mash and there are no continuous additions of sparge water to the surface of the mash."", ""Certainly sparging can be performed if desired, but it is neither traditiol nor necessary (corn kernels have no husk and therefore do not form a filterbed). Chicha is traditiolly allowed to spontaneously ferment. For the last type (Modern), George Duarte suggests that ground, unmalted corn could be mixed with a small amount of crushed 2-row malted barley and boiled for 20 minutes or so to gelatinize the starch in the corn."", 
""This gooey mass would then be added to more water and barley malt and mashed as per 'normal' homebrew procedures."", ""This could probably be sparged as usual."")",110

Zucchini Lasag (Lasagne) - Low Carb,,PT20M,PT1H,"Great for anyone going low carb OR who has so many zucchini, they don't know what to do!! :) We found the sauce to be very mild. I think it would be better with twice as much garlic. I boiled my zucchini slices for about 3 minutes so they were partially cooked. I wanted to make sure they were soft in the finished dish or I knew the kids wouldn't eat them. ;) The cottage cheese provides a slightly tangy note. I think we would have preferred ricotta, but that is persol taste. I use my 11x7 baking dish and got 6 pieces the size of what you see in my photos. Both of the guys ate two so it fed 4 of us, and I double the meat.

Not only do fruits make a colorful and flavorful accompaniment to breakfast, lunch or dinner, they make a refreshing and healthy sck in the middle of a hot day or under a welcoming shady tree on an outing with family or friends.

To freeze, arrange washed berries in a single layer on a baking sheet and place in freezer until solid. Transfer them to a plastic freezer bag or container, leaving half-an-inch at the top.

Linzer Bar,,PT30M,PT1H,"I adopted this recipe from Recipezaar in August 2006.  I haven't tried the recipe, but I hope to very soon.  Here is what the origil poster said about this recipe: &quot;You can take one of two approaches for the top crust here - a lattice top is more traditiol and a little more work - the dough can be a little crumbly so you need to add a little water to roll it out.  You can skip the lattice and simply crumble the top crust dough over the jam and bake.  It will look more like a cobbler.  Either way will taste just fine!&quot;","""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/15/64/pict7y6Af.jpg""",Bar Cookie,"c(""Dessert"", ""Cookie & Brownie"", ""< 60 Mins"", ""Oven"")","c(""1 3/4"", ""1/4"", ""1/4"", ""1/2"", ""1/2"", ""1/2"", ""1/2"", ""1/4"", ""1"", ""1/2"", ""2"")","c(""unsifted flour"", ""sugar"", ""brown sugar"", ""baking powder"", ""salt"", ""cinmon"", ""butter"", ""margarine"", ""dark corn syrup"", ""egg"", ""flour"")",4,2,235.4,8.3,,,,38.2,0.7,17,2.7,12,1,"c(""In a large bowl stir together flour, sugar, brown sugar, baking  powder, salt and cinmon."", ""With a pastry blender or two knives use scissor  style, cut in butter or margarine until coarse crumbs form."", ""With a fork stir  in corn syrup and egg just until mixed."", ""Reserve 1/2 cup batter."", ""Press  remaining batter into a 9x9x2-inch baking pan."", ""spread with jam."", ""Stir 2  tablespoons flour into the reserved batter."", ""If preparing a lattice add a couple tablespoons of water - one at a time - to make the dough easy to roll out.

I consider this 'perfect' chocolate cake. This cake is excellent with  both with Recipe #261024 and Recipe #208959 (the dark flavor version). (I use Recipe #95416 when I'm decorating the cake.) I love how the leftovers are still moist even a day or two later. (I store my loosely covered with plastic wrap.)
My father adores this cake with Recipe #261024 on it. For his birthday, Father's Day etc. I make him cupcakes with the icing on them and individually wrap them. He keeps them in his freezer for when he wants &quot;a piece of cake&quot;. He claims they are as good as when they are fresh. 
(Even though it isn't where I got the recipe from so I can't vouch for it, reviewers have said it is the recipe on the Hershey's cocoa can. I would recommend using their Special Dark Cocoa if possible.)","c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/96/WnJFBuTMQEj2PNZ1hLwg_batch23-7154.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/v1/img/feed/2496/ujrrQ86xQ8esU3YsXoyo_DarkChocCake.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/96/qg1ylT80TMGWTf1OrBAj_IMG_1461.JPG"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/96/Y9iikuBR2SyunbnXkWSm_IMG_20140814_145156.jpg"",

Pumpkin Pie Crunch,,PT15M,PT1H5M,"Several reviewers complain about the recipe being too sweet and/or too buttery as origilly written. I've included the amounts I use, which I think are 'just right'. Also, since I usually don't have pumpkin pie spice in the house, I use 1 1/2 tsp. cinmon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. cloves and 1/2 tsp. ginger instead.

I have also added the step of soaking overnight in salt water.  Amount of salt is approximate, but I never made any kind of pickle without any salt, as this recipe origilly was written.  Everything in this recipe is subject to change when I find my recipe.

I then put meal size quantities in zip lock bags and freeze  This saves hanging them up to dry.,"c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/34/74/f41wx70bRDmnv1JegL8d_pasta2%20(1%20of%201).jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/34/74/BHb5yZg0TbCIUCg7mtLG_CD4B433D-506D-4D85-85C2-2526CC1C2942.jpeg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/34/74/fhwT4duKQxmJD8xNNTuE_pasta1%20(1%20of%201).jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/34/74/pic5Lv13u.jpg"",

Best Basic Chocolate Chip Cookies,,PT25M,PT40M,"The following appeared in BH&amp;G Feb. 99.  I like it because I can make the variety preferred by whomever is visiting that day.  &quot;A few tweaks in the ingredients in chocolate chip cookies can dramatically change the outcome.  Want a crispy thin cookie?  Use an all-butter dough. Because butter melts more quickly than shortening in a hot oven, the dough spreads.  For a puffy cookie, use shortening to keep the dough from flattening.   Get a softer cookie by sweetening it only with brown sugar. Combine brown with granulated sugar for a crispier cookie.  Our tinkering resulted in three versions: Our Best Basic, Thin-and-Crispy, and Soft-and-Cakelike.&quot; By Jeanne Ambrose, BH&amp;G  Best Basic Chocolate Chip Cookie Prep: 25 min Bake 8-10 min per batch",character(0),Drop Cookies,"c(""Dessert"", ""Cookie & Brownie"", ""< 60 Mins"", ""Oven"")","c(""1/2"", ""1/2"", ""1"", ""1/2"", ""1/2"", ""1/4"", ""2"", ""1"", ""2 1/2"", ""1 1/2"", ""1"")","c(""shortening"", ""butter"", ""brown sugar"", ""granulated sugar"", ""baking soda"", ""salt"", ""eggs"", ""vanilla"", ""all-purpose flour"", ""walnuts"", ""pecans"")",4.5,12,103.4,6,,,,12.2,0.5,7.6,1.2,1,1,"c(""Thin-and-Crispy: Bake 10-12 min per batch."", ""1 cup butter, 3/4 cup packed brown sugar, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 2 cup all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate pieces, 1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans."", ""Soft-and-Cake-like  Bake 9-11 minutes per batch."", ""1/2 cup shortening, 1 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 2 slightly beaten eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 8 oz sour cream, 1 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate pieces, 1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans."",

Chocolate Mint Candy (Fudge),,PT30M,PT30M,"I love this recipe because it is so easy to make and yet it always gets 'oohs' when people see the candies and 'aahs' when they taste them!

I've gotten several z-mails asking about the candy coating. They are wafers that you melt to then dip candies into to coat them. They are usually sold in the candy section of craft or baking stores. I've seen them in the candy making section of Wal-Mart also. If you look at the ingredients photo on Recipe #104941, you'll see a photo of them. They are a different 'stiffness' than white chocolate chips but some reviews have successfully used those when they can't find the candy coating.
